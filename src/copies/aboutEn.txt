Pared (panel) is a visual art online gallery. We try to break down distinct walls: the one that divides groups of creators; the one that keeps away the beholder from the gallery; and the one that blocks the exposition spaces from the artists. We came up with a panel where we can expose the art to start with a dialog around their formal and thematic ideas, no matter the age or nationality.

Monthly, we will exhibit a new art propose. We will publish a catalog and an interview. Our priority is to impulse the exchange of ideas with the creators. Also, we want to offer the artist a document that helps them to amplify their portfolios so they can be able to expose in other spaces or apply for any kind of support. Finally, we will purpose the artist contact if you want to acquire any of their pieces.

We have a permanent process to select the artist. Our criteria are formal and also thematics. We keep open the possibility to artist to submit their work by themselves.

Pared is a project by migala.mx.
