This piece explores the material language of engraving, its installation and iconography as a vehicle to translate the experience of time. It interests on image duality as an instant that bifurcates itself, and the contradiction that engraving exists in his absence. The language used is similar to the one commonly associated with visual narratives and mythologies. But when it's removed from the pieces, the figures find themselves on an indecipherable narrative, as if the abstraction were part of his physical reality. Also it gets into the sublime experience and its relation with time. "And if I fail translating the dissolution of being, maybe in its search we will find each other".
