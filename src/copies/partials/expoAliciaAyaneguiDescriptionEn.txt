Painting for me means a constant dialogue with the environment in which I move every day, its changes and deterioration continually generate ideas in my mind that I seek to capture on paper or canvas. In my work, temporality is something fundamental, I take advantage of different lighting during the day, natural and artificial light as well as the atmosphere in the garden. I consider that my practice is based on the randomness of these circumstances, which I paint from life in order to transfer the impression I have of space from the gesture of matter and its accidents.
