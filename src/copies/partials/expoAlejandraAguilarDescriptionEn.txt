My work is configured upon a graphic and narrative approach which allows me to explore my own definition of Home: a place where memories of my own social and domestic life can inhabit, alter and transform in time; where I am able to develop a sense of belonging, grow and form an identity. I seek to make associations between social and cultural patterns and behaviors taught and inherited through generations.
I work with the idea of containers of time. I experiment with multiple mediums to find different ways to display stories and narratives. My practice is centered in drawing, woodcut, collage, and most recently animation. This multidisciplinary approach allows me to create depths and layers into my own imagery, and be playful with the materials and motifs as an important quality to generate non-linear graphic storytelling.
Since I am working with the concept of Home, I decided to engage with its material representation: a house. I have established the house as the physical place where images evolve and interact with each other. I devised a scheme to build graphic representations of these houses. They consist of a series of reduction woodcut prints. In them, elements such as windows, rooftops and chimneys can be arranged, cut and folded into three-dimensional paper houses. Reproduction is a central quality of my process, however each of these containers turns out be a unique piece. Every house serves as a stage for very specific moments suspended in time: scenes from my childhood as the stepping stones for the stories.
