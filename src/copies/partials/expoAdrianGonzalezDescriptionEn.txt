My artwork seeks to reflect on the images present in our context and the influence they have on the way we build and shape our perception of reality. Above all, is an attempt to establish a particular vision with my way of accessing the world and to make public a starting point to reflect on the experiential quality of painting, from two points of view: the attitude one has regarding images and one's own representation in pictorial practice.
Itâ€™s unavoidable to think that nowadays we live in a saturated visual environment that constantly repeats the same contents. Due to the speed and quantity with which images flows in diverse media (internet, television, cinema, etc.) we have become accustomed to observe with a minimum of astonishment diverse events that occur in our context.
My artistic research is based on the personal way, on how our ability to observe has been polluted with so much saturation of images evidencing the impossibility and anguish of visually dimensioning a series of events. Painting is presented to me as a tool to interpret and represent both formally and conceptually the relationship I establish with this visual excess, which has altered our ability to analyze and observe images. Hence my interest in exploring and questioning this relationship from this discipline, since it allows me to propose a possibility of a visual practice of resistance that corresponds to the organization of a certain visibility in what is the most experiential projection of the individual.
